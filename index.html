                            <p>A Portuguese international, Ronaldo was named the best 
                                Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football
                                 Federation in 2015. He made his senior debut in 2003 at 
                                 age 18, and has since earned over 160 caps, including 
                                 appearing and scoring in ten major tournaments, becoming
                                  Portugal's most capped player and his country's all-time
                                   top goalscorer. He scored his first international goal 
                                   at Euro 2004 where he helped Portugal reach the final. 
                                   He assumed full captaincy in July 2008, leading Portugal
                                    to their first-ever triumph in a major tournament by 
                                    winning Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the 
                                    second-highest goalscorer of the tournament.</p>
